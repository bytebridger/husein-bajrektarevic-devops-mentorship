# VARIABLES
# ==========

# A variable is a value that can change.
# Variables store information that can
# be referenced and used by programs.

# Instead of hardcoding the value in
# the code, we use the variable instead.

# Variables in python are declared
# in the format: name = value

# Example:

a_str = "This is an example of a string in quotes" # In python the word string is abbreviated to str

my_float = 5.5 # float number example

an_integer = 5 # integer is abbreviated to int

shopping_list = ["apples", "oranges", "pears"]

a_dict = {"userId": "JBloggs"} # dictionary is abbreviated to dict

my_var = another_variable # variable is abbreviated to var

test_function = my_function() #function is abbreviated to func

example_tuple = ("apple", "orange", "pear")

boolean_values = True # boolean is abbreviated to bool
