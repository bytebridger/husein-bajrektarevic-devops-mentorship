# ====================
# VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT
# ===================

# A virtual environment in Python is a container 
# in which all your code and other python packages reside.
# It allows you to keep your python configuration separate 
# from other versions on your system.
# often we will see a virtual environment called "venv"

# $ python3 -m venv myvenv

# activate it using: $ source myvenv/bin/activate

# any packages you use will be stored in a 
# folder structure inside your virtual environment.
